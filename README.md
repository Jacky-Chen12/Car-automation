# Car-automation
The Auto Renew file is Ardiuno IDE. We built it to support three servos on the Sifive Hifive 1 board Rev A01. 
(There is a lack of documentation for this board especially on Windows)
Slight modifications had to be made if you want it to work on native Arduino chips.
A python version is included as well.
The MQTT test allows for an easy setup for your main server and peripheral devices.
The facial recognition software used is linked from https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet
If you are unfamiliar with Google Colab I recommend using 
https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/nst_blogpost/4_Neural_Style_Transfer_with_Eager_Execution.ipynb
They explain every step quite well.
